<br>

I made this calculator in dark mode and light mode. as per user's wish he/she can change the mode of calculator.

There is a delete button, using "DEL" button we can delete numbers one by one from the end.
<br>

and also there is clear button, using "CL" button we can clear the screen simultaneously.
